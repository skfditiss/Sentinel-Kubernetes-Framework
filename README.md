# 🛡 SKF: Sentinel Kubernetes Framework

## 🚀 Overview
SKF (Sentinel Kubernetes Framework) is a **Zero Trust Kubernetes-based CI/CD pipeline** designed to integrate **DevSecOps principles**, ensuring security at every stage of the deployment process.

## ⚔️ ️  What is Sentinel?
Sentinel ensures **continuous security enforcement** at every stage of deployment, preventing unauthorized access and enforcing compliance policies.

## ![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kubernetes-326CE5?style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white) What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (K8s) is a **container orchestration platform** that automates application deployment, scaling, and operations across clusters.

##  🏰  What is a Framework?
A framework provides a **structured approach** to building, deploying, and securing applications with pre-configured toolsets and best practices.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Zero Trust Security** - Enforce strict security policies at all stages  
✅ **Automated Deployments** - CI/CD pipeline with Helm and Jenkins  
✅ **Container Security** - Scan images with Trivy before deployment  
✅ **Policy Enforcement** - OPA ensures compliance with security rules  
✅ **Runtime Threat Detection** - Falco monitors container activities  
✅ **Observability & Monitoring** - Prometheus and Grafana provide insights

## 🔐 What is Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)?
> "Never Trust, Always Verify" - A security model that enforces strict identity verification for every user and device attempting to access resources, minimizing security risks.

SKF incorporates **ZTA principles** by integrating robust **policy enforcement, vulnerability scanning, and runtime monitoring** in a Kubernetes-native environment.

## 🛠️ Toolset & Features

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
- **Jenkins** 🏗️ - Automates build, test, and deployment workflows.
- **Helm** ⛵ - Manages Kubernetes applications with package-based deployment.

### **Security & Compliance**
- **Trivy** 🔍 - Scans container images for vulnerabilities.
- **OPA (Open Policy Agent)** 📜 - Enforces security policies and compliance.
- **Falco** 🛡️ - Provides runtime security monitoring for Kubernetes.
- **SonarQube** 📊 - Analyzes source code for code quality and security vulnerabilities.

### **Monitoring & Visualization**
- **Prometheus** 📈 - Collects and stores real-time metrics.
- **Grafana** 📊 - Provides dashboards for monitoring security, system health, and performance.

---
## 🏗️ Architecture

1. **Code & Security Analysis:** Jenkins triggers SonarQube & Trivy scans for vulnerabilities.
2. **Policy Enforcement:** OPA validates Kubernetes resources against defined security policies.
3. **Deployment & Runtime Security:** Helm deploys applications; Falco monitors for runtime threats.
4. **Observability:** Prometheus collects security & system metrics; Grafana visualizes data.
